# blender-photogrammetry

Blender importer/exporter for Bundler file format to allow dense point cloud reconstruction from Blender's camera tracker.

After tracking and solving a clip in Blender, use this addon to export the data to the Bundler file format. This format can be used in a number of photogrammetry tools to rebuild a dense point cloud. After dense point cloud reconstruction (and optional meshing), the resultant model can be reimported into the tracking scene in place.

The current implementation has been tested with PMVS on Windows as follows:

* Track and solve a movie clip
* Export Bundler .out file (exports bundle.out, list.txt and all associated movie clip frames in JPG format up to 3000px on the largest axis; see PMVS documentation)
* If you enabled "Convert to PMVS" or "Execute PMVS", a subfolder named pmvs\ will be created with the Bundler files converted and images undistorted, ready for PMVS
* If you enabled "Execute PMVS" then PMVS will be run against the converted data from the previous step

**Note**: If 'Convert to PMVS' or 'Execute PMVS' is enabled, it's recommended you show the system console so you can track the progress of the Bundler and PMVS processes. Blender will become unresponsive during this time.

### 'Convert to PMVS' and 'Execute PMVS' caveats

Precompiled binaries for Bundler and PMVS are provided for Linux 32, and Windows 32 & 64 to allow running the reconstruction pipeline. Linux 64 works with "Convert to PMVS" but not "Execute PMVS". If you're using a different platform or architecture, "Convert to PMVS" and "Execute PMVS" will be unavailable via the addon.

To get Linux 64 (and probably 32) working you'll have to install libgfortran3 and possibly liblapack3. You'll also need to set the execute flag for the precompiled binaries in the addon folder. Navigate to a folder path similar to: ```~/.config/blender/2.79/scripts/addons/blender-photogrammetry-master/linux64/``` followed by ```chmod 755 *```

# Thanks

Special thanks to Noah Snavely, the author of Bundler, for giving me some pointers on getting the right matrix representations in the bundle.out file.
